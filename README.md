# Recipes

## a project for the fundamentals course in "The Odin Project"

This website consists of a simple HTML structure to present some simple recipes to the user
There is no CSS or styling in the website, it's purely made of HTML

the tags used in the websites are mainly paragraphs, headers, lists(ordered and unordered), links, and images.

This is a simple project, I will expand on it later if the chance permits.
