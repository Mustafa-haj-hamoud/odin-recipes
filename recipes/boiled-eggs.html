        This is the perfect dish for a good breakfast, it's nutritious, fulfilling, and delicious, it literally cannot get any better!
        Not only that, it's also cheap, and it's easy to make, I have this for breakfast almost daily.
        These eggs are cooked to perfection, all the people like me who do not like their eggs runny, gather here because this is the one and only right way to make boiled eggs.
