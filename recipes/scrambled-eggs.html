        Do you like your scrambled eggs cooked all the way? nothing runny or creamy. If so, then this recipe is for you.
        It might be a hot take, but I do not enjoy runny eggs in any form. Most scrambled eggs recipes out there do not cook the eggs all the way through, intentionally, which blows my mind.
        However, there's none of that here, no liquid in these eggs :D
